# HotelBookingSystem

This project implements a hotel management system using a microservices-based architecture. The system is designed to manage hotel listings, room bookings, user authentication, and payments with strong consistency and failure recovery using the Saga Pattern.

---

## üß© Services Overview

### üîê Authentication Service

- **UserAggregate**: Manages user profiles, credentials, and authentication tokens.

---

### üè® Hotel Service

- **HotelAggregate**: Contains hotel details, amenities, location, ratings, and policies.
- **RoomTypeAggregate**: Manages room categories, features, base pricing, and images.
- **RoomInventoryAggregate**: Handles available rooms by date range, pricing rules, and availability status.

---

### üìÜ Booking Service

- **BookingAggregate**: Stores reservation details, guest information, booking status (confirmed, pending, canceled), and booking history.
- **ReservationAggregate**: Manages room allocation, check-in/check-out dates, and special requests.

---

### üí≥ Payment Service

- **PaymentAggregate**: Tracks payment details, payment status, transaction history, and refund information.
- **InvoiceAggregate**: Contains itemized charges, taxes, discounts, and final pricing.

---

## üîÅ Booking Saga Flow

The **Saga Pattern** is used to handle distributed transactions across services with compensation logic for failure scenarios.

### Step 1: Initiate Booking (Booking Service)

- User selects room and dates.
- Booking service creates a **pending booking record**.

### Step 2: Verify Room Availability (Hotel Service)

- Booking service requests room availability check.
- Hotel service verifies and **temporarily reserves** the room.

üõë **Compensation**: If the booking fails, release the room reservation.

### Step 3: Process Payment (Payment Service)

- Booking service sends a request to process the payment.
- Payment service **authorizes the payment**.

üõë **Compensation**: If the booking fails later, the payment is **voided or refunded**.

### Step 4: Confirm Booking (Booking Service)

- Upon successful payment:
  - Booking service **confirms the reservation**.
  - Hotel service **updates room inventory**.
  - Payment service **captures the authorized payment**.
  - Booking service **sends confirmation** to the user.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Handling

- Each step of the saga includes **compensation logic** to maintain system consistency.
- A **Saga Orchestrator** tracks the process and triggers compensating actions when necessary.

## Ozge's notes

## Aysenur's notes

I have implemented the **authentication and authorization system** for handling secure access in the **Auth User Service**. The service manages user registration, login, JWT token generation, and role-based access control. It provides essential security infrastructure for the overall microservices ecosystem.

### Key Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

   - Implemented user registration with secure password hashing using **ASP.NET Core Identity**.
   - Built a login mechanism that issues **JWT access tokens** and **refresh tokens**.
   - Stored user data securely using **Entity Framework Core** with a dedicated **AuthUserDbContext**.

2. **JWT Token Management:**

   - Generated **access tokens** that include user claims (ID, email, roles).
   - Supported **refresh tokens** to allow users to renew their session without re-authenticating.
   - Validated tokens using issuer, audience, expiration, and secret key validation.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

   - Enabled assigning roles (e.g., "Admin", "User") to users during or after registration.
   - Restricted access to certain API endpoints based on assigned user roles.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture Support:**

   - Integrated **RabbitMQ** to publish user registration events for further processing by other services.
   - Promoted loose coupling and asynchronous communication across microservices.

5. **API Documentation:**

   - Configured **Swagger/OpenAPI** for clear and interactive API documentation.

6. **Security Best Practices:**
   - Enforced password policies: minimum length, complexity, and character types.
   - Implemented token expiration and refresh workflows to enhance security.

### **Expected Response (User Registration):**

```bash
{
  "id": "user-guid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "roles": ["User"]
}
```

This will trigger an event that can be consumed by other services if necessary:

```bash
üì© UserRegisteredEvent published: ID user-guid, Email user@example.com
```

## Nƒ±gar's notes

I have implemented the **SAGA pattern** for handling the `ReservationCreatedEvent` in the **Payment Service**. The process simulates a payment transaction with success and failure scenarios. A consumer listens for the `ReservationCreatedEvent` and triggers the payment logic. Depending on the result, either a `PaymentSucceededEvent` or `PaymentFailedEvent` is published.

### Key Features

1. **ReservationCreatedEvent Handling:**

   - **Aggregate**: `PaymentAggregate` handles the domain events.
   - On receiving the `ReservationCreatedEvent`, the payment process is triggered.
   - The payment process is simulated, with a 50% chance of success or failure. Based on the result:
     - If successful: A `PaymentSucceededEvent` is published.
     - If failed: A `PaymentFailedEvent` is published.

2. **Test Consumer for Payment Simulation:**

   - A consumer (`ReservationCreatedConsumer`) listens to the `ReservationCreatedEvent`.
   - Upon receiving the event, it simulates the payment process and logs the success or failure.
   - The result of the simulation triggers either the `PaymentSucceededEvent` or `PaymentFailedEvent`.

3. **Message-Based Communication:**
   - **RabbitMQ** is used for event messaging between services:
     - **BookingService** sends the `ReservationCreatedEvent` to the `reservationQueue`.
     - **PaymentService** consumes the event and simulates payment processing.

### **Expected Response:**

```bash
{
  "id": 1,
  "hotelId": "hotel-123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "checkInDate": "2025-05-01",
  "checkOutDate": "2025-05-05"
}
```

This will trigger the payment simulation, if payment is successful:

```bash
üì© ReservationReceived: ID 1, Hotel: hotel-123
üí≥ Processing payment for User: user-456, Hotel: hotel-123
‚úÖ Payment successful for reservation ID: 1
üì§ Event published to payment_succeeded: {"reservationId":1,"userId":"user-456","hotelId":"hotel-123"}
```

## Buse's notes

I implemented a test **SAGA pattern** for handling the **ReservationCreatedEvent** in the **Booking Service**. This process simulates a payment transaction with success and failure scenarios. Additionally, the test consumer was created to simulate the payment process, and necessary Docker containers for MySQL and RabbitMQ were set up.Nigar will continue for payment.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **ReservationCreatedEvent Handling**:

Aggregate - Reservation
Domain Event - ReservationCreatedEvent

- Implemented a test **SAGA pattern** for handling `ReservationCreatedEvent` in the `Booking Service`.
- Upon receiving the event, a **payment simulation** is triggered.
- The payment simulation has a 50% chance of success or failure. Based on the result:
  - If successful: **Payment succeeded** is logged.
  - If failed: **Payment failed** is logged.

### 2. **Test Consumer for Payment Simulation**:

- Created a **dummy test consumer** that listens for the `ReservationCreatedEvent` and simulates a payment process.
- Based on the success/failure of the simulated payment, an appropriate message is logged (success or failure).

### 3. **Docker Setup**:

- Configured **MySQL** container for database operations:
  - Database: `booking_db`
  - Username: `root`
  - Password: `123456`
- Configured **RabbitMQ** container for event messaging between services.

---

## Testing with Curl

To simulate the `ReservationCreatedEvent`, you can use the following **`curl`** commands to send HTTP requests:

### 1. **Send a Reservation Created Event**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/reservations \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "hotelId": "hotel-123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "checkInDate": "2025-05-01",
  "checkOutDate": "2025-05-05"
}'
```

### **Expected Response:**

```bash
{
  "id": 1,
  "hotelId": "hotel-123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "checkInDate": "2025-05-01",
  "checkOutDate": "2025-05-05"
}
```

This will trigger the payment simulation, and you should see the log output like:

```bash
üì© ReservationCreatedEvent received. Reservation ID: 1
üí≥ Processing payment for User: user-456, Hotel: hotel-123
‚ùå Payment failed for reservation ID: 1
```
